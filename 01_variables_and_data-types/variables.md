# Variables

Variables represent pieces of data

```py
mystring = "Don't Panic!"

myint = 42
```

You can't use spaces in the variable name

```py
my string = "This is an invalid variable name"
my_string = "Use an underscore instead of spaces"
```

Some characters and words are reserved and can not be used in variable names

```py
my*variable = "This is an invalid variable name"
my_variable* = "This is also an invalid variable name"
my-variable = "You also can't use dashes. Stick with underscores."
```

The name of the variable can also not begin with a number

```py
1my_variable = "This is an invalid variable name"
my_varibale1 = "This one will work though"
```

Variable names can use lower and uppercase characters

```py
MY_VARIABLE = "Variable names like this are often used for data that should not change"
myVariable = "This variable name is written in what is called Camel Case"
```

You can use the print() function to output things to the terminal

```py
print("You can print text like this")
print(mystring)
print(myint)
```
